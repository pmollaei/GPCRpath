This repository is the implementation of the paper "Activity Map and Transition Pathways of G Protein Coupled Receptor Revealed by Machine Learning". This project uses shallow ML models to predict activity level and activation state of a given protein. To present the performance of the ML models we used MD trajectories of Beta2AR receptors in different conformational states including agonist, apo, and inverse agonist.
